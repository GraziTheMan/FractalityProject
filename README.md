## 🌌 Vision

The Fractality Project is creating a novel social knowledge platform where users map their thoughts using interactive, fractal-based mind maps and discover resonant connections with others across the network. We're building a new form of collective consciousness infrastructure that enables ideas to evolve, connect, and crystallize into new knowledge structures.

## 🚀 What's New in v0.13.0

This release represents a major architectural evolution from our initial Alpha roadmap. We've moved beyond simple mind mapping into a comprehensive consciousness platform with:

- **Living 3D Universe**: Interactive fractal visualizations powered by Three.js
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Seamless protocol for AI assistants to create and manage nodes
- **Consciousness Architecture**: Triadic consciousness system with parallel processing engines
- **Multi-Modal Interface**: Web visualizer, data console, and mobile-ready components
- **Advanced Analytics**: Resonance engines with TF-IDF, semantic, and hybrid matching

## 🎮 Quick Start

The app is a **no-build static ES-module app served by a small Express +
Socket.IO server** (the same server provides the realtime layer for chat/feeds).
Three.js is vendored (`vendor/three/`) and resolved via an import map, so there
is **no bundler/build step**.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GraziTheMan/FractalityProject.git
cd FractalityProject

# Install dependencies (express + socket.io)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start          # or: npm run dev  (nodemon, auto-reload)

# Open http://localhost:3000   (redirects to the app entry, public/index.html)
```

The server honors `PORT` (defaults to 3000) and is what `Procfile` /
`render.yaml` deploy. `git ls-files` also contains several archived/experimental
trees (`public/legacy/`, `src/legacy/`, `json/`) that are not part of the running
app.

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🌟 Interactive 3D Universe
- **Fractal Visualization**: Nodes arranged in mathematically beautiful patterns

## 🎮 User Interface Guide

### 📊 Data Console (`data-console.html`)
The primary interface for creating and managing nodes:

**Human Interface:**
- Manual form-based node creation
- Visual property customization
- Relationship management
- Data import/export

**AI Protocol Interface:**
- Paste AI-generated node definitions
- Batch processing capabilities
- Real-time validation
- Protocol documentation

### 🌌 3D Visualizer (`index.html`)
Interactive exploration of your fractal universe:

**Navigation:**
- Click nodes to focus and explore
- Hover for detailed information
- Keyboard shortcuts (R=reset, P=performance, Q=quality)

**Data Loading:**
- Test patterns (Simple, Balanced, Golden Spiral, Organic, Stress Test)
- Custom JSON files
- URL-based data sources
- Example universe data

## 🛠️ Architecture & Modularity

### 🏗️ Modular Design Philosophy

The platform follows **strict separation of concerns** with truly modular components:

#### **Standalone Modules**
- **Data Console**: Complete independence - can run without main app
- **Mobile Interface**: Self-contained radial navigation system  
- **CLI Tools**: Python backend for batch processing and analysis
- **Visualization Engine**: Three.js renderer with swappable layout engines

#### **Shared Infrastructure** 
- **LocalStorage Bridge**: Seamless data sharing across all modules
- **Protocol Standards**: Unified AI Protocol v2.0 across tools
- **Configuration System**: Central config management
- **Node Schema**: Consistent data structures (NodeData.js)

#### **Clear Boundaries**
```javascript
// Each module has defined interfaces:
DataConsole → localStorage → Visualizer
AIProtocol → ValidationLayer → NodeCreation  
MobileUI → EventSystem → CoreLogic
CACE Engine → Analytics → UIFeedback
```

### 🧠 Intelligence Layers

1. **Data Layer**: Ultra-lean node structures with efficient lookups
2. **Intelligence Layer**: Stateless engines (CACE, Resonance, Layout)
3. **Visualization Layer**: High-performance Three.js rendering
4. **Interface Layer**: Modular UI components with platform-specific optimizations

### 🔄 Integration Patterns

**Loose Coupling**: Modules communicate via:
- Standardized data formats (JSON schemas)
- Event-driven messaging
- LocalStorage as shared state
- Protocol-based interfaces

**Development Benefits**:
- Work on Data Console without affecting 3D visualizer
- Test mobile interface independently 
- Swap layout engines without touching UI
- Add new intelligence engines as plugins
