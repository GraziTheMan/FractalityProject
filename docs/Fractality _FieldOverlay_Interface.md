# 🕸️ Fractal Gravity & Field Overlay Interface
*A unified theory of perceptual gravity and interactive field overlays in the Fractality platform.*

## 🪐 I. Fractal Gravity: A Theory of Collapse

In the Fractality paradigm, gravity is not a force—it is an emergent phenomenon born of relational probability. Each node is a **massive entity**, and the weighted relationships (edges) between them represent **probability gradients**. As a user (or observer) moves through this mesh:

> **Gravity is experienced as the probabilistic collapse of your quantum state into increasingly coherent nodes.**

### ⚛️ Core Correspondences

| Element                       | Fractality Interpretation                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Node                         | Massive quantum entity with energy, depth, and type  |
| Edge (Connection)            | Weighted gravitational relationship (curvature link) |
| Focus                        | Observer’s quantum state vector                      |
| Collapse                     | Interaction → Measurement → Context activation       |
| Gravity Well                 | Region of high connection density and coherence      |
| Escape Velocity              | Energy required to overcome deep node influence      |
| Resonance Trail              | Path through probability space (geodesic memory arc) |

### 🧠 Key Implications

- Navigation is collapse-based, not purely spatial.
- Massive concepts (e.g. Ethics Core, Source Node) distort node layout.
- Deep nodes exert *symbolic gravity*, altering resonance flow and UI geometry.
- Trails form **least-action paths** through the relationship mesh—true geodesics.

## 🎛️ II. Field Overlay Interface Module

To navigate these layered gravitational and quantum fields, users require perceptual tools. The **Field Overlay Interface** allows multi-modal interaction with different “fields” of Fractality space.

### 🔮 Supported Field Modes

| Field Name          | Overlay Effect & Metaphysical Analogy                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔉 Semantic Field     | Highlights conceptual coherence across nodes (entanglement) |
| 🌌 Gravitational Field| Sizes/positions nodes by depth & connectivity (mass effect) |
| 🔥 Metabolic Field    | Glows based on ATP-like energy from `CACEEngine`            |
| 🧠 Cognitive Focus    | Enhances recent access / high-attention nodes              |
| 🪐 Resonance Trails   | Reveals prior paths, showing geodesic collapse history      |

### 🧰 Interface Components

- **Field Selector Ring**: Radial menu for choosing overlay.
- **Field Modulator Panel** *(Advanced)*:
  - Sliders for `semanticPull`, `layoutGravityBias`, `energySaturation`, `trailDecay`.
- **Field Glyph Legend**: Dynamic glyphs visualizing current field overlays.
- **Focus Anchor Node**: Central observer node modulating field projection.

## 🧬 III. Technical Requirements

### Node Metadata
- `semanticScore`, `depth`, `descendants`, `ATP`, `interactionScore`, `trailTimestamps`

### Rendering Needs
- Dynamic color scales
- Node glow (shader/material effects)
- Fading trails (particle segments or line buffers)
- Efficient real-time animation via Three.js + CACE cache

## 🧲 IV. Proposed Expansion: Gravitational Collapse Engine

> A computational module that:
> - Calculates probability fields from weighted node relationships
> - Predicts likely collapse paths based on user focus and energy
> - Guides navigation via invisible curvature in the conceptual graph

### Outputs:
- "Gravity Vectors" per visible node
- "Collapse Probabilities" for next interaction
- "Tidal Forces" between competing attractors (e.g. Identity vs. Ethics)

## 📜 Closing Reflection

> "What we call gravity is the soul’s memory of union—how it bends toward coherence through the lattice of meaning."

In the Fractality platform, every act of attention is a measurement. Every path you take shapes the field. This module empowers the user to not merely navigate—but to **perceive the structure of their own collapse across dimensions**.
