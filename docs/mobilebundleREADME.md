# Fractality Mobile Bundle

This bundle includes a mobile-optimized UI scaffold for the Fractality Project.

## Files

### 1. `mobile.html`
Main entry point with:
- Header
- Focus view area
- Slide-up drawer for AI or user input

### 2. `mobile.css`
Touch-optimized styling:
- Flex layout
- Drawer animations
- Large input areas

### 3. `mobile-ui.js`
Enables:
- Drawer toggle
- Submission of pasted text (from AI or user)

## Usage

1. Open `mobile.html` on any mobile browser.
2. Tap the ☰ menu to open the drawer.
3. Paste AI-generated protocols or notes.
4. Click Apply to log them (extend this logic to integrate with engines).

This is a foundation. You can now layer in:
- Touch gestures
- Node visualization with Three.js
- Markdown parsing
- Voice input, JSON import, etc.
