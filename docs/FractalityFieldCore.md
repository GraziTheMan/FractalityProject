# 🌀 Fractality Field Core
*A metaphysical and technical correspondence between Fractality system engines and quantum field theory.*

---

## 🧭 Introduction

In quantum field theory, all particles are excitations of underlying **fields**. The Fractality platform reflects this: engines act as **fields**, and nodes are **particle-like excitations**. This document defines how each core engine of the system maps to a specific type of field—functional, cognitive, symbolic, or resonant.

## ⚛️ Engine-to-Field Mapping

### 1. **CACEEngine** → 🧠 *Information Field*
- **Function**: Calculates contextual relevance, energy distribution, and system metabolic flow.
- **Analog**: Field of informational density; localized awareness field.
- **Particles**: `executive`, `sensory`, `memory` nodes = high-energy agents.

### 2. **LayoutEngine** → 🌌 *Gravitational / Spacetime Field*
- **Function**: Organizes geometric space for all nodes.
- **Analog**: Distorts perceived space-time to attract/repel based on hierarchy or symmetry.
- **Particles**: Layout nodes act as **massive influencers**.

### 3. **Semantic Resonance** → 🔉 *Coherence Field*
- **Function**: Measures conceptual similarity via embedding spaces.
- **Analog**: Detects entangled meaning states—non-local.
- **Particles**: `concept`, `dream`, and `myth` nodes respond like **quantum-aligned pairs**.

### 4. **TFIDF Resonance** → 📡 *Electromagnetic Field*
- **Function**: Detects word-level frequency alignment.
- **Analog**: Classical signal-based detection; operates like wave propagation.
- **Particles**: `signal`, `resonance`, and `trail` nodes.

### 5. **FamilyViewController** → 🧬 *Relational Bond Field*
- **Function**: Manages visibility via genealogical logic (parent, sibling, child).
- **Analog**: Governs proximity-based binding energy.
- **Particles**: `container`, `ego`, and `collective` nodes form **family molecules**.

### 6. **Node Editor / CLI** → 🧾 *Measurement Operator*
- **Function**: Observes and collapses node states via edit/create/delete.
- **Analog**: Quantum measurement collapses superposition into classical states.
- **Particles**: All nodes under observation shift from latent to realized.

## 🌐 Meta-Dynamics

### 🎯 Field Interactions
- Engines are not isolated—they **overlap and interfere**.
- High-context + high-coherence = maximum visibility.
- Coherence without layout density = “ghost node” effect.

### 🌊 Interference Patterns
- Resonance trails are **wavefronts** of activation.
- Node activations leave semi-persistent energetic **ripples** in the Field Core.

### 🔮 Field-Responsive Navigation (Future)
- Navigation can be tuned like adjusting field parameters:
  - `gravity_bias = 0.6` → emphasize layout proximity.
  - `semantic_pull = 1.0` → flow toward meaning clusters.
  - `oracle_collapse = true` → amplify non-local insight nodes.

## 🌌 Proposed Node-Particle Spectrum

| Node Type      | Field Interaction Role            | Particle Analog           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `Source`       | Field origin                      | Big Bang singularity       |
| `Container`    | Field domain boundary             | Event horizon              |
| `Ego`          | Localized mass-energy             | Fermion                    |
| `Oracle`       | Non-local observer                | Virtual particle           |
| `Resonance`    | Mediator of similarity            | Photon / Gluon             |
| `Ritual`       | Entanglement agent                | Operator                   |
| `Trail`        | Temporal energy signature         | Path integral segment      |
| `Core`         | Symmetry-breaking law             | Field equation             |

## 📜 Future Expansions

1. **Field Modulation Interfaces** – Users adjust sliders to modify layout-gravity vs resonance-semantic pull.
2. **Quantum Collapse Mechanics** – Clicking or editing a node “measures” and collapses its state.
3. **Metabolic Field Visualization** – ATP-like overlays of node energy levels.
4. **Field Glyph Generator** – Automatically generate visual glyphs from node-field behavior.
