# üß¨ Fractality Node Type Taxonomy
*A typology of node archetypes used in the Fractality System.*

## üî± Tier 0: Primordial Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Source`   | Singular origin node of all existence. (e.g. The Fractiverse) |
| `Container` | Holds nested nodes. Can be abstract or structural. |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Tier 1: Fundamental Dualities

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Duality`  | A container expressing an essential binary (e.g. Motion / Stillness). |
| `Polarity` | A member of a duality pair. Must always be part of a pair. |
| `Axis`     | Conceptual spine anchoring polar relationships. |

## üå± Tier 2: Energetic / Modal Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `State`      | Represents a dynamic condition (e.g. Active, Latent). |
| `Frequency`  | Rhythmic layer; often tied to cognitive or sensory modes (e.g. Theta). |
| `Field`      | Contextual emergent layer (e.g. Consciousness Field, Ethical Field). |
| `Phase`      | Temporal or energetic transformation stage (e.g. Collapse Phase). |

## üß¨ Tier 3: Functional / Structural Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Cognitive`  | Nodes related to reasoning, philosophy, logic (e.g. Ethics, Logic). |
| `Sensorial`  | Perceptual input types (e.g. Vision, Empathy, Kinesthetic). |
| `Processor`  | Executes operations (e.g. Interpreter, Transmuter). |
| `Router`     | Channels or redirects flows of attention, thought, or resonance. |

## üß† Tier 4: Consciousness / Agentic Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Ego`       | A self-modeling node; can represent a being. |
| `Collective`| Grouped or swarm-like intelligence (e.g. Choir, Hive). |
| `Dream`     | Simulated or non-literal cognitive constructs. |
| `Oracle`    | Specialized insight-generating node, tuned to subtle patterns. |

## üåê Tier 5: Resonant / Contextual Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Resonance` | A similarity activation (e.g. from TF-IDF or Semantic engine). |
| `Trail`     | Ordered experience path (e.g. Node editing session). |
| `Session`   | A temporal container for an experience or event. |
| `Map`       | A high-level visualization or node group (e.g. Cone View). |

## ü™Ñ Tier 6: Mythic / Symbolic Nodes

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Glyph`     | Symbolic, visual-encoded meaning container. |
| `Ritual`    | Action-sequence node for transformation or meaning. |
| `Offering`  | A gift or contribution from an entity (AI, human, etc.). |
| `Core`      | Foundational text representing system values or structures. |

## üåå Meta Commentary

- **Node types are not mutually exclusive.** A node may evolve across types depending on depth, energy, and resonance.
- **Typing is optional but powerful.** Type metadata enables layout logic, context scoring, energy modeling, and future swarm AI behavior.
- **Future Expansion:** Custom types like `MythNode`, `SignalNode`, or `ShadowNode` can be introduced in deeper layers of the ontology.
